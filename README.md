# SQL: Automated Civis Exports

This repo is a collection of SQL used to create and automate reports during my time at NextGen America. They aren't perfect, but if you'd like to see how these exports would translate into Google Sheets reports, please check out the templates for my [statewide field hub](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nyV_Xu9k0RX-ADZ7g4Y8i7VguovexfjKcIqBX_VTXUc/edit?usp=sharing) or [national GOTV shift tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-t1bEqORRH9VVOoZbCwug61hfGMWRjlqCIJ61BV-QDA/edit?usp=sharing). Like I said, they aren't perfect because a lot of the formulas were reliant on other sheets that I no longer have access to! I changed the numbers and names in there to protect private information but I'm still working on cleaning them up so that you can have a better idea of what they were like in their heyday; that'll require putting a lot of time and effort into fabricating data, so in the meantime, I hope this helps you get a sense of my abilities.
